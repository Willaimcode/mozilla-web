<h1>What's really happen in our mind? </h1>

<h2>1. Introduction </h2> 

<h3>There are many conceptual resonances in our decision, and these conceptual resonances are an important principle under the expected mirror theory. We have seen thathas found the resonance amplification and vibration protein in the ion channels on the neuronal dendrites of rat brains 1. This result from the physiological level of brain neurons provides a physiological basis for our expected mirror theory. At the same time, VEN  has carried out a lot of research, proving that VEN is the basis of empathic neurons（2,3）.

At present, there is still no clear definition and description of the working principle of VEN. In addition, there is no clear explanation for how the various resonances and shocks of the brain in the rat experiment relate to the formation of our concept. Through the principle of the resonance of the expected mirror theory, we can penetrate some conclusions of the above physiological basis, and analyze our daily decision-making process through cognition-frequency-oscillation-resonance.

In the George Floyd protest incident, this matter was very obvious. We explain this for this. </h3>

<h2>2. The main point of view of the principle of conceptual resonance of expected mirror theory</h2> 
<h3>2.1 The chaotic decision in the chaotic brain prevents people from taking the right actions</h3> 

<h3>2.2 Cognitive pattern formed by language resonance, people add new vocabulary or concepts, the past model is often difficult to ignore.</h3> 

<h3>2.3 The media storm caused by low-cost information is making more people’s brains in a normal state of transition and chaos.</h3> 


<h3>2.4 Phase extraction, adjustment and locking are our decision-making process.</h3> 


<h3> VEN is actually to establish a coordinate origin of the other party in his own mind. That is to establish a frequency in the other party’s mind.</h3>
